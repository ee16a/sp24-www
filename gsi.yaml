I am really interested in Computer Architecture, (so far :). 16A is one of the best classes I've taken at Berkeley because of the unique perspective it gives one on solving real world problems with the simplicity of linear algebra. I'm very passionate about aviation, technology, soccer and F1. I love traveling, hiking and endurance running and biking. Oh and I thoroughly enjoy talking to people, so feel free to hit me up!"

I have not been in a class that has lab as interesting as the EECS16 series. Outside of academics, I love to cook or learn about food. I also enjoy playing the piano and listening to classical music(love TwoSetViolin’s YouTube channel). Exercising can also bring me joy. Lastly, welcome to 16A and I hope you enjoy it!"
