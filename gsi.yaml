    bio: "Hi, Iâ€™m Sabriya! I came to Berkeley from Purdue University, in my home state of Indiana (so you know Iâ€™m a fan of corny jokes!). Iâ€™m now a 3rd-year PhD student in Computer Science, and I work with Professor Niloufar Salehi, doing research at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Human-Computer Interaction. Iâ€™m passionate about improving AI systems to more effectively support underserved populations in socially impactful sectors like education and healthcare. I study how algorithmic systems impact these communities, and I work on building and testing AI tools to mitigate disparities. Outside of research, I love to read (usually with boba in hand), volunteer in the community, and hang out with my cat. This is my second time as a GSI, and I look forward to a great semester!"
