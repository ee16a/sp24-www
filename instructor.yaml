  bio: "Lauraâ€™s research is in computational imaging, which brings together optical physics and computational algorithms to develop cameras and microscopes that can image efficiently in multi-dimensions. Laura's research spans optics, signals & systems, machine learning and bioengineering, and she's excited to show you how 16A principles can help you build a camera with just Scotch Tape and a sensor. Laura used to have hobbies like hiking, traveling and sleeping, but now has two little kids instead :)"
